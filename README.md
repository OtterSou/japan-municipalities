## Notes

### Entities with identical names

Some entities in Hokkaido have identical names.

* Tomari Village
  * `01403` Shiribeshi General Subprefectural Bureau, Furuu County
  * `01696` Nemuro Subprefectural Bureau, Kunashiri County, part of disputed Northern Territories
* Kamikawa County
  * `01830` former Ishikari Province
  * `01832` former Teshio Province
  * `01857` former Tokachi Province
* Nakagawa County
  * `01833` former Teshio Province
  * `01860` former Tokachi Province

2 towns named Esashi Town (`01361` and `01514`) can be distinguished by their names in kanji. (江差町 and 枝幸町 respectively)

### Designated cities

Each designated city constitutes a prefecture subdivision by itself. To make the hierarchical structure consistent, each designated city has an entry duplicated in levels 2 and 3 with types 21 and 31.

### Hokkaido counties

Hokkaido uses subprefectures instead of counties to assign codes to towns and villages, even though there are counties in Hokkaido. Because the counties do not have official 5-digit standard area codes, I assigned them codes between `01801` and `01876`.  
These county codes are by no means official, and only exists to provide information about which town/village belongs to which county.

### English/Romaji names

Romaji spelling of administrative divisions follows [Notation Rules of Geographic Names, etc. in English](https://www.gsi.go.jp/common/000138865.pdf) by [Geospatial Information Authority of Japan](https://www.gsi.go.jp/) (GSI) in the tables. However, There are several instances where an entity's name has more than one romanized spelling. For example, `27220` 箕面市(みのおし), Osaka Prefecture is romanized Minoo City based on the GSI rules, but the city officially prefers Minoh City.  
Such variations are summarized in [spelling-variants.tsv](spelling-variants.tsv). This list may be expanded as more of such inconsistencies are found.

English names of suffixes follow the GSI rules as much as possible. When a term is not specified, one from English Wikipedia is used.
